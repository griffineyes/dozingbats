## Road Map. 
  
Although the client facing version of the game is free to use indefinitely, it is not intended to be fully open source. There are assets in the game that require licensing. There is also a children's story book nearing publication and other properties which require protection.  
  
Eventually this game will become an AI cybersecurity game hunting bugs and flaws in code.
